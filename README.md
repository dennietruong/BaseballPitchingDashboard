# Baseball Pitching Dashboard
In this repository, I have attached a R Markdown (along with the csv data) of the shiny app built to display analyze my player pitching performance during the 2025 Spring season.

The dashboard can be visited at: https://dennietruong.github.io/BaseballPitchingDashboard/
