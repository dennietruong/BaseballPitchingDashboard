# Baseball Pitching Dashboard
In this repository, I have attached a document of relevant files (along with the csv data) of the shiny app built to display analyze my player pitching performance during the 2025 Spring season.

The dashboard can be visited at: https://dennietruong.github.io/BaseballPitchingDashboard/
